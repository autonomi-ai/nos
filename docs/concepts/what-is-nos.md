## From hand-rolled Pytorch to Inference APIs
Writing and maintaining model deployments is hard. So hard, in fact, that many/most developers have 
switched to using Inference APIs from OpenAI, Huggingface, Replicate and the like. While their underlying approaches differ the end result is the same: developers want to be able to hit a REST endpoint and forget about it.
